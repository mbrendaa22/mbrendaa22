- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... brn.martinezlujan@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... don't know how to program but i know how to program

- My way of learning is not just by taking courses, to be honest sometimes I get bored and distracted so as I am quite organized I started writing in 'notions' a little about some technical concepts that can help me and why not others...
